This is a short synopsis of the documentation, included in the file `synopsis.md` in the `scenes/` directory (the default).

The documentation tells you the overview of the software, the philosophy behind it, explains the workflow, and shows some examples.

If you run the examples, you'll eventually see this synopsis in the documentation. Congratulations!
