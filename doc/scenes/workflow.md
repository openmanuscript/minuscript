A minuscript manuscript is defined as:

- Title page
- Table of contents (optional)
- Synopsis (optional)
- One or more chapters. A chapter is a collection of scenes.

There are a few required files:
- **manuscript.json** This file defines the title of the manuscript and the structure of the manuscript by collecting scene files into chapters.
- **author.json** This file defines the author's information.

I'm using this to write my next manuscript, and get it into readers' hands. I'm also using it to write the documentation for the software, to suss out some its limitations. I'll adapt it to the workflow as I go.
