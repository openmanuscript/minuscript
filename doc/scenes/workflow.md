A minuscript manuscript is defined as:

- Title page
- Table of contents (optional)
- Synopsis (optional)
- One or more chapters. A chapter is a collection of scenes. A scene is either
  a text file, or a scan of something that is treated as a full page of text.
- Integrated footnotes or end notes (optional).

The `minuscript` data specification provides a definition of the data needed to
achieve the above.
