One of the ways that I work is by freewriting on a typewriter, and then scanning those pages to keep them digitally. Those pages can then be integrated into a draft manuscript as scenes.

The next scenes show this. PDF files can be integrated one by one, with scene dividers between them. Maybe not the best system, but it works for short things.

Try it!
