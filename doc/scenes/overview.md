The philosophy behind **minuscript** is distraction-free production of manuscript drafts by bridging the gap between simple text editors and manuscript organization, in a format that will be around for a long time[^ I have manuscripts I have been working on for 10 years. You will, too ... eventually.].

There are plenty of distraction-free writing tools, and I've tried most of them [^ Scrivener and iAwriter are two of my favorites. I have designed this workflow to work with both tools, as you'll see later in the documentation.]. There are very few distraction-free workflow tools. This is one that might work for you.

I want to build a simple tool that helps you stay focused on the writing workflow. As a developer, and writer, I don't want to get distracted by user interfaces, long lists of features, or a lot of debate about the tool. The best tools are hammers. **minuscript** is a hammer. 

**Separation of Text from Tools** 

A big problem in the longevity of a bit of writing raw material is the tools that you use to create it. I know it sounds crazy, but I've done this long enough to have tried using lots of tools, and of course I discovered that very few writing tools are designed to support the *workflow* of writing a manuscript. Let's face it - Microsoft Word is great for small bits of writing, but sucks for supporting the creation of fiction. It's too hard to manage the order of scenes, too hard to go back to previous versions of things, try alternate passages in context, etc. Basically anything that you'd want to support the act of creating a work of fiction Word fails.

My assumption is that a good workflow is to get a manuscript completed, sent out, and get on to the next one. Along the way, there are plenty of times when you want to let something sit and then come back to it, in order to get a fresh perspective on it. The **minuscript** workflow is designed for that kind of re-entrant workflow. You can let something site, work on the next thing, and be confident that when it's time to get back to the manuscript, you'll be able to remember where you were, and get to work again.
