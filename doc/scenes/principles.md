**Principles**

- The most important thing is the story. Nothing else matters. It would be great to have a reason to produce any format imaginable (ebook, html, word, etc.) but unless there's a great story behind it, the format is meaningless. A corollary to this is that I don't care about whether an editor wants a pdf, docx, or name-your-own format until I have an editor or an agent.
- Cross bridges when you come to them, not before. See above.
- Do one thing well.
- Knowing your stories are safe (backed up), organized, annotated (what was I thinking?), and accessible from any new computer is a way of calming the mind.
- A manuscript is a great big GTD project, and it can be managed the same way. Let's call that GND - the "Getting Novels Done" method. It's highly unlikely that a little nagging tidbit of information about a main character's second cousin's dog will be important in the final draft, but things like that can slow you down, so I want to support writing that stuff down and forgetting about it.
- All things being equal, I'd rather be writing manuscripts on typewriters, but there's a lot to be said for the invention of the computer.
- I'm in this for the long haul.
- I don't want to keep track of a bunch of paper, unless it helps me write.
- The only thing that matters is the story.
