This is an example of an alternative organization of the documentation, provided to show you how you can manage multiple manuscript organizations, versions, etc.

You could include something like `10_pager.json` along with a regular `manuscript.json`, for example, if you want to create a short version to submit to a critique group. **minuscript** will pay attention to the manuscript file you point it to, and leave the others alone.
