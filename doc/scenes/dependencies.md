**Dependencies On Other Software**

**minuscript** takes advantage of some foundational software in order to be so simple. Linux and Mac have most of this already, or it's easy to install.

For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assume you know or can find out how to install all of this. I use ports on my Mac, but if you're using Linux, you already know how to install this stuff.

- Python
- latex and pdflatex
- multimarkdown
- JSON data files. This is a file format that's really easy to us in pythons scripting. Again, if you're using this workflow, I'm going to assume you are comfortable with a file format like JSON, and can be careful editing these files.
- An editor of your choice. I use vim.
- A version control system of your choice. I use git. This is not strictly required by multimarkdown but it's important in the workflow.  See the discussion above for the reasons.
