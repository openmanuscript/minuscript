Thanks for downloading minuscript

To get started:

Everything you need is in the git repository. Instructions assume a facility
with basic tools used in coding, so I assume you can do things like edit a 
makefile and other operations like that.

Good luck, and please contact me with suggestions. If you'd like to help code
minuscript, we can talk about that, too.

In the repository directory:

1. Edit the makefile to install minuscript in a directory of your choice
2. make install
3. cd doc 
4. minuscript
5. you will now have a document called 'documentation.pdf' which is the 
   documentation for minuscript. By reading that document and looking at the
   files in the directory, you will have all the information you
   need to create your own manuscripts

For help:
